# GCP Cloud Architect Certification Labs

This repository contains the labs and exercises that I completed as part of my preparation for the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Cloud Architect Certification. The labs are designed to help participants gain practical experience in working with GCP services and also prepare for the Cloud Architect certification exam.

The labs cover a wide range of GCP services and was made to prepare peoples to build Cloud Architectures. Each lab folder contains the Terraform files used to deploy the infrastructure and code necessary to complete the lab.

I completed these labs as part of a six-week challenge offered by the GDG Cloud Nantes and other GDG Cloud communities. The challenge provided me with access to training materials on the Cloud Skill Boost platform and weekly check-ins with mentors to review progress and answer any questions.

The labs are organized by their corresponding lab identifier, which can be used to find more information on the specific lab on the Google Cloud website. Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference for your own GCP projects or as part of your own preparation for the Cloud Architect certification exam.
